# subclass sl3_Task with information about nodes and DAG
# might have to get into NP-SEM here, but can default NP-SEM for now
# function to generate subtask for each relevant factor of the likelihood
# update as learner so can be fit to novel data (numerical optimizer might work well here)
# numerical delta method
# need ability to get Q and g predictions for both A observed and all counterfactual a levels (support for multiple counterfactual regiemes simultaneuosly)
